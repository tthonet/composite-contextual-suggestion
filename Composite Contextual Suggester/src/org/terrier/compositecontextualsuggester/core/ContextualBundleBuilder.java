/**
 * This class is used to build the bundles of venues. An instance of this class
 * is designed to be used as described thereafter.
 * After the creation of the instance, the rated venues (i.e. the venues that 
 * have been rated by the users), the local venues (i.e. the venues that have
 * been pre-filtered based on a context), the (Foursquare) categories and the
 * user (defined from his profile) are set using their respective setter 
 * methods.
 * Then, some overall statistics are computed about the venues (e.g. the 
 * maximum number of "likes" for a venue) by calling the method 
 * computeVenueStats.
 * The next step consists in generating a definite amount of bundles. This is
 * achieved by executing bobo (bundles one-by-one).
 * Finally, a limited amount of bundles (the best ones) are chosen from the
 * ones generated with bobo by calling the method chooseBundles. It creates a
 * list chosenBundles of venue bundles ordered from the bundle with the best
 * score to the bundle with the worst score.
